# Installation

You can clone this repository and build the app using tools like [electron-prebuilt](https://github.com/mafintosh/electron-prebuilt). I didn't test it on `Windows` or `Linux`, but I made binaries for them and it works.

There is also an OS X prebuilt binary in the `bin` directory of the repo. You can simply download the zip file, extract it and drag the single binary app to your `Applications` folder.


# Ideas?

Just fill an issue and describe it. I'll check it ASAP. :)


# Contribution

This app is just a simple test. It's nor perfect or even good at all! But you can fork the repository, improve or fix app and then send the pull requests back if you want to see them here. I really appreciate that. :heart:

Remember to lint your code before sending pull requests. Do the grunt lint task by running the following command and fix the errors if you get any.
```bash
grunt lint
```
